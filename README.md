This is a basic Java Script code quiz with an unrelated bonus question. The quiz starts when the user clicks on the start quiz button. The user has 10 seconds to answer before is will automatically move to the next question. The users score is displayed at the end of the quiz as a percent.

Update---11/14/19

Added a prompt on load for user name.

Added high score button to quiz. Styled it to match the start button. Currently its commented out as I can't get it to disappear on button click in the JS file.

Still need to add the high score function to save user input from the prompt in local storage.
